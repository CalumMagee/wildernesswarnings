# WildernessWarnings
Disables options to enter the wilderness on High Risk and Target worlds.
Spells cast from your spellbook such as Annakarl Teleport are not included 
in accordance with Jagex guidelines. Also not included is the agility shortcut from Trollheim 
because nobody has ever used that shortcut in their life.
